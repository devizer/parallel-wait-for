WAIT_FOR_MySQL="Server = mysql1; Port=3306; Uid = root; Pwd = your_password; Connect Timeout = 5" \
Wait_For_Http_Google_404="https://google.com/404; Valid Status = 404; Timeout = 3" \
./WaitFor -Timeout=60 "-MsSql=Data Source=sqlserver1; User ID=sa; Password=your_password; Timeout = 5"
```

### http
Along with basic http(s) check it allows to specify:
* check or ignore https certificates: `Allow Untrusted: true|false;`
* specify valid status codes. for example `Valid Status: 200;` or `Valid Status: 42,100-399`;
* check for a REST API endpoint, for example
```
http://mywebapi:80/get-status; Valid Status=200,403,100-499; Allow Untrusted = true; Method=POST; *Accept=application/json, text/javascript; Payload={'verbosity':'normal'}"
```

By default an self-signed certificate is allowed and valid statuses are 100-399
